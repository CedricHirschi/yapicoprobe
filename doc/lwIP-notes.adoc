## Some lwIP Notes

lwIP is used for creation of a network interface of YAPicoprobe to avoid
an uncountable number of additional CDC com ports. +
Currently just a Segger SysView server is listening on port 19111.
But I guess there is more to come.

lwIP had some traps waiting for me.  Despite reading the official
https://www.nongnu.org/lwip/2_1_x/pitfalls.html[Common Pitfalls]
I took some of them.

MAC:: Do not use a random MAC!  At least not for the first byte.
   I was "lucky" choosing one with an odd first byte.  Unfortunately
   bit 0 marks a group address.  At least Linux rejects such MAC
   addresses with a more or less useless error message in the syslog.
   Took a while until I found out that the MAC address was the culprit
   for no communication. +
   Finally I have used 0xfe as the first byte and the remaining five
   bytes of the MAC address are copied from the last bytes of Picos serial number
   (which actually is the serial number of the external flash).
   
OS Mode:: *really* take it serious what they are writing about "raw" APIs
   and only using the TCPIP thread for any calls to it. +
   Use `tcpip_callback_with_block(<func>, <void-arg>, 0)` for
   non-blocking invocations of some function.  This also saves you
   from creating extra simple threads for communication tasks line
   in the TineUSB/lwIP glue code.  That was my first idea and it took
   a while until I found out how bad that idea was. +
   Same was true for the thread(!) which stuffed data for SysView into
   it's server:  bad idea! +
   Effect of wrong API handling were random crashes or connection
   disruptions.
   
RNDIS/ECM/NCM::
   * *RNDIS*: this was my former favorite, because it is supported by all
     relevant OSs.  Also throughput seemed to be good. 
     Unfortunately RNDIS seems to manipulate routing in a way that the
     default route on my Linux wants to go through the probe.  Not
     really what I want...
   * *NCM*: is said to be the best choice.  I did not manage to get an
     acceptable throughput.  Transfer seems to get stuck from time to time
     and SystemView aborts.  So also not the favorite.
   * *ECM*: works good, packets are transferred continuously, throughput
     also seems to be ok.  So this is the way to go. +
     Unfortunately there is no driver integrated into Win10, so possible 
     extra trouble appears.
